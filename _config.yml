About This Collection: "The reunification of the Chinese empires under Mongol rule in the Yuan dynasty (1271-1368) saw a cultural shift towards syncretism of different cultures. The arts, particularly paintings, showed evidence of the mixing and coexistence of diverse cultures, people, ideology and religion.

This exhibition showcases a selection of paintings by Han-Chinese artists that depicts the idea of the foreign and ethnic other, visually and/or figuratively. The visual evidence is obvious in the depiction of figures with different ethnicities (such as people from Central or Western Asia), clothing and religious anecdotes or symbols. The other can also be depicted metaphorically and symbolized by the supernatural, as seen in Gong Kaiâ€™s painting.

Whether or not the artists intended for these works to be pure visual depictions or to contain political and personal messages, all of these paintings function as a visual peek into society. Serving as a helpful way to better understand and describe the complexity and dynamics of the Yuan dynasty culture.
