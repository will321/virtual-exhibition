The legend of Zhong Kui came from the Tang dynasty Emperor Xuanzong, who one day dreamt of a large man (Zhong Kui) appearing to attack and devour a demon that broke into Xuanzong’s palace when he fell ill with a fever. Since then, the figure of Zhong Kui served as a talisman against demons and harmful spirits. Scholars have argued that this painting by Gong Kai contains possible messages, perhaps in political protest against the Mongol rule or as a self-reflective critique of fellow scholar-officials.",Supernatural;Zhong Kui;Procession;Myth;Handscroll ,"Washington, United States of Ameria
